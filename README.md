# Flutter Provider State Management
Using Provider package in this repository to fetch data from api and show it in UI. Provider is just wrapper around Inherited widget class. Here we are using Provider to achieve state management in our application.

#### Advantages of Provider:
- simplified allocation/disposal of resources
- lazy-loading
- a vastly reduced boilerplate over making a new class every time
- devtool friendly â€“ using Provider, the state of your application will be visible in the Flutter devtool
- a common way to consume these InheritedWidgets (See Provider.of/Consumer/Selector)
- increased scalability for classes with a listening mechanism that grows exponentially in complexity (such - - as ChangeNotifier, which is O(N) for dispatching notifications).
